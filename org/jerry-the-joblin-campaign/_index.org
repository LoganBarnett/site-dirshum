* Introduction

The last few hundred years of relative peace between the nations of the world
has been silently attributed to something only the ruling elite know of - a
secret proxy war that is conducted completely at the expense of the orcs.

Every nation backs an orc tribe, providing them weapons, magicks, training, and
more.  The orcs are then pitted against each other by means of careful
manipulation.  Through the outcomes observed in these engagements, military
strategists are able to infer how a full scale war might go.  This informs
diplomatic stances, and helps allocate appropriate research and funding to
military forces.

Lately though, a tribe of orcs has risen quickly above the rest, sporting
weaponry far beyond anything the world has seen before.  Some are calling this
"artifice", and an actor named "Jerry the Joblin" is the mastermind behind this.

The party is sent to learn of Jerry's motives, and potentially stop Jerry.

* Characters

** Aarion Valor

Aarion Valor is the patron of the party.  He says he works for an unofficial
group of nations who don't like what's going on with Jerry the Joblin.  His goal
is to ascertain Jerry's exact level of involvement, goals, and possibly stop
Jerry.

Aarion has hired each member individually.  His monetary rewards have been
generous.  He also has hooked each party member with something he knows will
interest them about this quest.

Aarion is an older human, with a gaunt appearance.  He limps on a metal cane,
and wears a greatcoat.

** Berb Minesworth

An artificer consultant who travels with the party representing Nomasgard.  Berb
has given the PC party consultation, and has offered to exchange information if
they should bring back some devices.

** Amaya Dungees

A priestess of the Raven Queen and under the employ of [[Aarion Valor]].  Amaya
hails from the city of Monrithon.  She carries a porcelain mask that she uses
when calling upon the Raven Queen's power.  The mask appears to have been
shattered at one point, and then reassembled using gold leaf.

While Aarion doesn't get too involved in the inter-party dynamics, he has warned
that Amaya has some sentimental value to him and he'd prefer if she stayed alive.

** Edric Varnell

The owner of [[Varnell's Arcane Provisions]].

** Thalendra Silverbranch

A high elven magic user who leads the entourage from Bel'Aheldan.  They have
come back after some time (long by most species' standards - decades) to check
on their handle at an orc fortress, only to find they can't reach their handle.

** Vaelis Duskthorn

A high elven, former moonstone researcher for Bel'Aheldan.  Vaelis was rescued
by the party on the way to Gazgren as part of the slave trade.  His enslavement
was the sentencing he was given by his nation because of his research.

The party gave Vaelis a handsome amount of walking around gold.  He said he
would stick around in the [[Vellmarch Outpost]] to assist his liberators with
anything they need.

* Locations
** Known Locale

With the capture of drones and a drone operator, the party is able to maintain a
map of the nearby area.  This represents the party's current understanding of
immediate location surrounding the orcs and the party's pursuit of Jerry.

** Vellmarch Outpost

A border town between nations of [[Gazgren]] and [[Nomasgard]], roughly near the
tri-nation area where the [[Tribes of Egalstan]] meet.  It is west of [[Monrithon]].

This is the last settlement of [[Nomasgard]] before entering [[Gazgren]].

** Monrithon

The largest nearby city on the [[Nomasgard]] side of the border.  Monrithon is known
for the home of the heroes that stopped the invasion of Orcus during the last
Sque Valan (a world-impacting cosmic event).

** Smooth Dragon

The local inn and tavern.  The tavern is upstairs.  Usually there's a few locals
around, but travelers also stop by.

The sign has a dragon on it, but no scales.  It's a pretty simple sign though -
just an outline of a dragon.

* Organizations

** Nomasgard

A mostly-human nation, but also a melting pot.  The capital, Duranae, is
situated far to the east.

** Gazgren

The land of the orcs.  Not really a nation in a strict sense, but the orcs know
the boundaries well.

** Tribes of Egalstan

The loose territory and name given to the tribes-people of Egalstan.  Egalstan
is not a nation but the collective name given to the human and giant-blooded
peoples living in that area.  The boundaries there are not strict, but the stone
markers that vaguely identify the area are unmistakable.

** Varnell's Arcane Provisions

A magic and potion shop run by [[Edric Varnell]] located in the [[Vellmarch Outpost]].

** Varnell's General Provisions

[[Edric Varnell]] is expanding his business and with it now runs the general store
in town.
