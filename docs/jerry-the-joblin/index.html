more. The orcs are then pitted against each other by means of careful
manipulation. Through the outcomes observed in these engagements, military
strategists are able to infer how a full scale war might go. This informs
diplomatic stances, and helps allocate appropriate research and funding to
military forces.</p><p>Lately though, a tribe of orcs has risen quickly above the rest, sporting
weaponry far beyond anything the world has seen before. Some are calling this
&ldquo;artifice&rdquo;, and an actor named &ldquo;Jerry the Joblin&rdquo; is the mastermind behind this.</p><p>The party is sent to learn of Jerry&rsquo;s motives, and potentially stop Jerry.</p><h2 id=characters>Characters<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#characters>#</a></h2><h3 id=aarion-valor>Aarion Valor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#aarion-valor>#</a></h3><p>Aarion Valor is the patron of the party.

is to ascertain Jerry&rsquo;s exact level of involvement, goals, and possibly stop
Jerry.</p><p>Aarion has hired each member individually. His monetary rewards have been
generous. He also has hooked each party member with something he knows will
interest them about this quest.</p><p>Aarion is an older human, with a gaunt appearance. He limps on a metal cane,

given the offer of vengeance against the orcs. Vladimir was granted the promise
of power and freedom. Freedom was immediately granted in a real sense - Aarion
immediately unlocked the magic muting collar. He held up a large, triangular
but smooth cornered stone with a hole in the middle. He bid Vladimir put his
hand through it. Vladimir did, and from it his power increased.</p><p>Aarion explained that the orcs of Gazgren play out a sort of dress rehearsal for
war. The various nations have orc tribes that they back - specifically
providing weapons, teach magicks, and provide other resources. The orcs fight
each other. From that, the nations get an idea of how a full scale war would
play out, to some degree of accuracy they are happy with. This then informs
diplomatic postures, research into magic, and how much to invest in various
armaments. This has been going on for some time, and in high positions of
government, the various nations (except Gazgren) attribute this half-proxy
half-dress-rehearsal war to the last several hundred years of relative peace
between the nations. There is also belief that if the orcs are too busy
fighting themselves, they won&rsquo;t be busy fighting their neighbors.</p><p>There have been previously no-named orc tribes rising to prominence, and they
are using weaponry never seen before: Firearms and mechanically assisted melee
weapons. This seems to be a rapid advancement in the school of artifice. The
only name they have to attribute to this is &ldquo;Jerry the Joblin&rdquo;. This has been
rather disruptive to the proxy wars. Jerry&rsquo;s affiliation and motives are not
known. Aarion has been contracted by a loose coalition of nations (the specific
nations were not disclosed) to ascertain affiliation and motive, and potentially
be ready to stop Jerry.</p><p>Aarion suggested for their first mission that they attack a stronghold for the
Tharkhun tribe. It was a middling tribe that perhaps represents the most pure
form of Orc ideology - Might makes right. They were recently bested in combat
by one of the firearm wielding war bands, and are just now starting to recover.
Aarion thought it would be a good point of initial information, as well as a
good way for the party to work together while the stakes could be kept
relatively low. It was about half a day&rsquo;s travel from the Vellmarch Outpost
they were at.</p><p>The party set out. The early summer weather made for an easy walk. The land
around here is characterized by grasslands atop rolled hills, with patches of
dense trees frequently sprouting up. The stronghold itself was a fort built of
raw lumber and rope. On each corner, a look-out tower (though the front left
one was destroyed). Only one of the towers seemed to be stationed. The party
waited until night fall, and came in on the side furthest from the watch tower.
They quickly discovered the orcs kept goblin slaves. A little too much noise
was made - two orcs jumped over their stronghold wall to attack them on either
side. The two orcs were quickly dispatched. They made their way around the
fort, though not as stealthy as Rashel needed her lantern to see in the dark.
The orc shaman stood in the open inside the fort. Two other warrior orcs, more
strongly built than the first two they dispatched, were at his side, kneeling in
the direction of the fort opening.</p><p>The shaman stated to the party that he yielded to their superior strength. The
party would have rights to claim spoils. He introduced himself as Grakgor
Bloodfist - a keeper of the old ways.</p><p>The party used this as an opportunity to gather information. In addition,
Rashel wanted all of the slaves freed. The slaves were freed with the
understanding that the shaman could keep his remaining warriors.</p><p>They learned that the fort had recently been attacked by orcs wielding Jerry&rsquo;s
weapons. The weapons were very destructive, and the shaman&rsquo;s forces really
didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. The shaman also gave them the location of the attackers.
The attackers should still be roaming around, attacking other strongholds and
riding off of their victory. Their current stronghold would be stationed with a
skeleton crew. The party took the chance to examine some of the damage done to
the fort. They found a wad of smashed metal - possibly lead. The party said
they may return for more questions, to which Grakor was happy to accommodate.</p><p>The party quickly returned to Aarion and showed the metal to him. He paid them
50 gold for their trouble, and offered 75 for bringing back some weapons. The
party set out again, this time on horseback using their newly acquired money.</p><p>Upon arrival, it was a somewhat similar scene - raw lumber and rope erected
forts, and neighboring clearing so anyone approaching would do so in the open.
Someone was stationed in one of the watch towers.</p><p>The party approached on the far side during daylight, and made it there without
issue. They scaled the fort walls and found goblin slaves working a mill of
some sort. There were many orcs there, as well as one watching the goblins.
The orcs in the courtyard were doing target practice. The boom of their
firearms was thunderous, and their aim terrible. The party managed to lure out
the slave driver and kill him. Vladimir used his magic to lure the courtyard
orcs out of the fortress. Rashel freed one of the goblins, but the watch
tower orc spotted them, and fired some explosive ballistic at them, killing one
of the goblins. The fight began in full. The party was able to fend off the
orc in the watch tower and the orcs coming back in from over the wall were taken
down with the hold of the recently freed goblins.</p><p>In the exchange, Rashel took a nasty blow from one of the mechanical melee
weapons - a sort of axe with moving teeth where a blade would be. Vladimir
studied what appeared to be a cannon of sorts below one of the watch towers.</p><p>The goblins were thankful, and fled into the wilderness.</p><p>The party brought back all of the weapons they found. They provided these to
Aarion and Vladimir produced an illusion recreating the cannon. Aarion was both
impressed with the party&rsquo;s work, their haul, and what he referred to as a rapid
advancement in the artifice, even if it was a bit crude by his standards. He
even mentioned something about how this was an early version of something, but
didn&rsquo;t elaborate further.</p><p>Aarion paid them more than agreed - 100 gold each. He said he would need time
to come up with a next move for them, and said they should meet again in a
week&rsquo;s time.</p><p>Total, the party gained 1750 XP.</p><h3 id=session-2>Session 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#session-2>#</a></h3><p>Aarion visited Vladimir and introduced Amaya Dungees to the party. Amaya&rsquo;s
family is close to Aarion, and he called her in as a sort of repaid favor. She
had recently completed her training in the priesthood for the Raven Queen. She
would be providing support to the party.</p><p>Rashel spotted orcs transporting slaves. They were being transported in broad
daylight, and the town guards didn&rsquo;t seem perturbed by this. Amongst them was
an elvish magic user (identified by his magic muting collar). Rashel
attempted to free the slaves by sneaking up and picking the lock, but was
unsuccessful. Rashel ordered oil
of slipperiness, and gave her wand of pyrotechnics as collateral. It would take
a day to brew. Later, at night, Rashel snuck up and tried picking the lock
again, this time breaking a pick off inside the lock. The next day, Rashel
picked up the oil and managed to throw it to the elf. The slave wagon departed
some time later. A day later, the elf returned to express thanks.</p><p>He introduced himself as Vaelis Duskthorn. He specialized in moonstone
research. He&rsquo;d done some things to make himself a political problem, and was
disappeared from elvish society via imprisonment and later sold into slavery to
orcs. He told them that one of the long term projects with moonstone was to use
it to prolong the elvish life - to achieve true agelessness. He didn&rsquo;t get into
his specific area of research. Rashel gave him 40 gold. Vaelis said he could
stick around and be of help to them, especially with that kind of money. The
party entertained the idea of introducing Vaelis to Aarion, but Amaya cautioned
that it would put Aarion in the position of having to betray his employers, and
while Aarion can be very generous, he also has a ruthlessness to him as well -
so Aarion&rsquo;s stance of being able to help or turn Vaelis back in was not known.</p><p>Aarion returned somewhat early to Vladimir, and gave him a map to his next stone
of power. He produced a map and warned him to be careful. The map placed this
stone about 4 days travel into Gazgren.</p><p>The party noticed quickly a small dot flying overhead - seemingly stationary to
them. If they listened carefully, they could hear a steady but faint
buzzing. They also noticed another dot like it in the distance, moving
perpendicular to their present course. The dot would cross their path in some
hours. They noticed their own dot would lose them if they crossed into a
forest, but would quickly find them again and resume following.</p><p>The party continued, and decided that maybe the other dot also had someone
traveling under it. They stopped and hid when the other dot was getting close.
In this location, they were before a break in the tree line. This clearing
provided great visibility to another stronghold - this one seemingly made of
scraps of metal. Under the other dot, crossing in front of them was a part of
10 or so orcs, brandishing weapons. The orcs were oblivious to the hidden
party. They were on their way to the metal stronghold. A slit opened up on one
of the stronghold&rsquo;s walls, and it boomed with a glittering smoke coming from it.
There was immediately an explosion amongst the orcs. Several of them were gone.
Some were dazed or confused. A few others charged. Another boom left about
three orcs left, and they fled.</p><p>The party decided to give the stronghold a wide berth to continue their journey.
After they broke one a later tree line, they found the sky was now filled with
more of these dots - some stationary and some slowly moving.</p><p>They came across some area where an engagement happened near two small hills.
They found a bloody scrap of clothing - someone had been killed here and their
bodies removed. By the time the party had an idea of what was going on, the
orcs sprung their trap. Seven orcs charged them, with one with a larger tubed
weapon. The party fought hard, with Rashel and Vladimir losing consciousness
at some point (and sometimes more than once). Each member was brought near
death. The orc in the back with the large gun lowly lobbed incredibly
destructive shots at them. Though they managed to defeat all of them.</p><p>Afterwards the party went back into their knot of trees and hid and rested.
Orcs passed by looking for them during the night, but the party wasn&rsquo;t
discovered.</p><p>The party arrived at the location on the map. It was in a larger cluster of
trees. As they explored deeper, the air became frigid. As they continued, it
got colder. Ice formations were on the pine needles and bark. Later it turned
to snow. They spotted the stone of power floating, but something passed in
front of it - nobody was able to make out what it was in the distance, but
something was there. They got closer and discovered it was a white owlbear,
walking around the stone. The owlbear seemed to sense them even though they
were well hidden. It approached them. Vladimir cast a spell that didn&rsquo;t really
work on the owlbear.</p><p>From the owlbear came a stern female voice, saying this was Vladimir&rsquo;s
challenge. They would engage in a non-lethal fight. If he passed, he could
have the stone.</p><p>Vladimir consented, and they started their fight. Vladimir was
able to hold back the owlbear with the clever use of magic. Rashel tried to
sneak around to get the stone, but the owlbear cautioned that he would fail the
test if others intervened. The owlbear had superior might to him, but was only
able to attack him once.</p><p>The owlbear was defeated, and collapsed into a druidic elven form. She healed
Vladimir, and gave him the stone as promised. She said sometimes the best use
of magic isn&rsquo;t from its raw power but its clever application, as was
demonstrated here.</p><h3 id=session-3>Session 3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#session-3>#</a></h3><p>Aarion gave the party a mission to capture some drones, a drone operator, and
any related equipment. One of the strongholds they thought would be good to
take was the one they came across earlier that they witnessed drones
coordinating a cannon strike on an orc raiding party.</p><p>The party snuck in at night, and was able to quickly dispatch the orcs defending
it. One orc got away. They did capture a goblin calling himself Jerry, and
frightened him into submission. They were able to take back quite a haul,
including the drones, drone control equipment, the intact equipment on the
operator, and the operator himself (Jerry).</p><h3 id=session-4>Session 4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#session-4>#</a></h3><p>Ganvur was tasked with discovering the recent orc incursions into the sacred
wood, &lt;name>, and put a stop to their ferocious weapons that cut down and maimed
trees with ease. When he was asking around in the Vellmarch Outpost, Aarion
quickly found and recruited him - promising better results since they had common
cause.</p><p>The first activity for Ganvur was to locate Vladimir, who had not been seen that
morning. Amaya and Ganvur set out with a bucket to locate Rashel. Rashel
wasn&rsquo;t passed out drunk in a gutter somewhere, but instead was working
studiously on some potion brewing. Amaya and Rashel exchanged some verbal
jabs.</p><p>They went to Vladimir&rsquo;s room at the inn. The door was forced open. The
bed sheets spilled to the floor. Vladimir&rsquo;s belt was slung over a chair and
other belongings left the table next to it. Ganvur transformed into a dire wolf
and picked up the scent: Orcs. Perhaps two. There was also a grappling hook
still hanging from the window. Ganvur and party went to the rope downstairs and
fro there, they picked up a scent. They followed it out of the outpost.</p><p>About two hours out, they came across a grassy butte. They could see a lookout
just barely at the top of the butte, but details were too distant to make much
out. Rashel snuck around the foot of the butte and found there were many
lookouts around the top, somewhat evenly but distantly spaced.</p><p>They snuck closer and were able to determine it was a skeleton. Rashel used
her darkness to approach and was able to destroy the skeleton without it even
fighting back, as it could not see her. From there the party headed to the head
of the butte. That&rsquo;s where they saw the altar. Ganvur sent his raven familiar
over.</p><p>Amongst several skeletons standing guard, there were two orcs there proceeding
with the ritual, and a person meeting Vladimir&rsquo;s description laying atop the
altar. They had just sprinkled cinnamon. Ganvur knew of this ritual - an
offering of atonement by sacrificing the object that presented the &ldquo;excuse&rdquo;, and
cinnamon meant the ritual was nearing its end, which would mean a very dead
Vladimir.</p><p>The party ambushed the orcs. The ritual casting orc and the scout that popped
out later attempted to flee, but all were felled including the skeletons.</p><p>They were able to revive Vladimir and bring him back.</p><p>Since the party&rsquo;s actions were coming back to bite them, Aarion decided they
should join him in his keep. Aarion opened a large metal door behind his chair
with relative ease considering it&rsquo;s perceived weight. Aarion showed to the
right was a hallway that contained his library - mostly journals in a series of
closet-like rooms filled with books. He asked the party not to go in there, but
he&rsquo;d be happy to reveal it in time. To the left were rooms. The party members
staked out their own rooms. Here there were no windows. Rashel left her
things in a room but slept in the hallway.</p><p>At night, Amaya nudged Rashel awake. In just a night gown, Amaya looked much
smaller as opposed to her armored form. She said she was a little disappointed
that Rashel hadn&rsquo;t gone in the library yet. With a quick glance they both
snuck into the library.</p><p>In the first book-closet, they found the books were numbered - by their guess,
year markers. They found one that was dated for next year. Amaya grabbed that
book and quickly thumbed through it. One entry stated that Rashel had
perished due to an orc artifice cannon of some kind, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough of
a body to restore. It also stated that Amaya was devastated by this, and that
the author would have to help her.</p><p>Amaya suddenly regretted this excursion and returned the book. Rashel grabbed
it and found that entry along with other entries about orc movements and battle
plans - nothing of much substance with more digging more could be found.
Rashel took the book back to her hallway corner and read under a blanket with
candle light.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the hobbled footsteps and tink of a cane were heard.
Rashel cast darkness on herself but it was too late. Aarion said there were
to be no spoilers yet. Rashel fearfully slid the book back. Amaya blamed
Rashel for the hijinks and Ganvur checked in, only to see it was just madness
and went back to bed. Aarion took the book and returned it.</p><h3 id=session-5>Session 5<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#session-5>#</a></h3><p>The party members individually awaken without a sense of time of day, due to
lack of windows in the rooms. But the smell of breakfast tells them it&rsquo;s time
to rise. The desk in Aarion&rsquo;s office has been pushed back, and a larger table
setup to accommodate the party. Plenty of food has been set, and it was still
hot. Members would dig in as they came.</p><p>Eventually, Aarion arrived and unfurled a map. This is a map of the surrounding
region. Aarion said it was produced from the information gathered from the
drone and drone operator. With more drones and operators, Aarion claimed he
could provide even more information such as individual movements, details of the
orc fortresses, and resolve details that couldn&rsquo;t be seen before.</p><p>The party decided to go to one of the closer orc strongholds. First, Ganvur
sent out his familiar to gather intelligence. Along the way he got to see a
drone in operation. It paid his familiar no mind and moved at a somewhat slow
walking pace, but he had no indication if this was its full speed or it. It did
not struggle in the wind.</p><p>The stronghold itself had many orcs there, and there seemed to be a sort of
rhythmic sound coming from it.</p><p>When the party was about to gather some more intelligence from the tavern in the
Vellmarch Outpost, they heard a commotion in the streets. A gang of orcs had
arrived, and they were making their presence known by being noisy and
belligerent. The orcs spotted one of the town guards and their leader stated
they were here to settle a feud under the border accords, and the orc pointed at
the party as indication of the target of the feud. The town guard thus
acquiesced, but remained to observe. People had already cleared the streets.</p><p>Rashel snuck around the buildings in the back while the party approached. The
orcs explained how the party had made a name for themselves in orc territory,
and if orcs brought down the party, it would do much to show how orcs were still
the best warriors. The party had been identified by a single survivor made from
one of the strongholds the orcs had attacked. The orcs had taken away his
pepper box and mechanical axe and given him traditional orc weapons. This orc
was able to identify some members of the party.</p><p>Rashel&rsquo;s sneaking with her darkness up spooked some shop owners, whose shop she
was sneaking through to flank the orcs. The orcs picked up on the commotion and
Rashel dropped the attempt, and rejoined the party.</p><p>The party had almost gotten the orcs to believe the witness-orc was a liar, but
they were there for a fight to prove themselves, and so at the slightest
agitation they attacked.</p><p>The fight ended and the party was able to take down the orcs non-lethally. The
captives were brought back to Aarion&rsquo;s office, where he setup a room to keep the
orcs in.</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://loganbarnett.github.io/site-dirshum/>Dirshum</a></span> ·
